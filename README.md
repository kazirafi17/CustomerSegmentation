# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. Customer segmentation is a crucial strategy for businesses to understand their customers better, allowing them to tailor their marketing strategies, improve customer service, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into several key steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**
2. **Handling Outliers**
3. **Managing Duplicates and Missing Values**
4. **Feature Engineering**
5. **Feature Scaling**
6. **Data Visualization**
7. **K-Means Clustering**

## Steps and Methods

### 1. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves cleaning and organizing the data to ensure it is suitable for analysis. This step includes:
- Importing necessary libraries.
- Loading the dataset.
- Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and content.

### 2. Handling Outliers
Outliers can skew the results of our analysis, so it's important to identify and handle them appropriately. Methods used include:
- Visual inspection using box plots.
- Statistical methods to identify and treat outliers.

### 3. Managing Duplicates and Missing Values
Duplicates and missing values can lead to inaccurate analysis. Steps taken include:
- Identifying and removing duplicate records.
- Handling missing values using imputation techniques or removal if appropriate.

### 4. Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve the performance of the machine learning model. Techniques include:
- Creating new features based on domain knowledge.
- Transforming existing features to enhance their predictive power.

### 5. Feature Scaling
Feature scaling ensures that all features contribute equally to the analysis. Methods include:
- Standardization (z-score normalization).
- Min-max scaling.

### 6. Data Visualization
Data visualization helps in understanding the data better and communicating findings effectively. Techniques used include:
- Histograms.
- Scatter plots.
- Box plots.
- Pair plots.

### 7. K-Means Clustering
K-Means clustering is used to segment the customers into distinct groups based on their behavior and characteristics. Steps include:
- Determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method.
- Applying the K-Means algorithm to the preprocessed data.
- Analyzing the resulting clusters to derive meaningful insights.

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation.git
   ```
2. **Install the required libraries:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Jupyter notebook:**
   Open the notebook file and run the cells sequentially to perform data preprocessing, feature engineering, and clustering.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

## Results
The final output of the project is a set of customer segments, each with distinct characteristics. These segments can be used for targeted marketing campaigns, personalized customer service, and other business strategies.

## Conclusion
Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering provides valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences. By following the steps outlined in this project, businesses can better understand their customers and make data-driven decisions to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.
